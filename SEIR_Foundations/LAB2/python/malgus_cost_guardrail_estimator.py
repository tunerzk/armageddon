# Reason why Darth Malgus would be pleased with this script.
# Malgus enjoys crushing enemies—but he hates wasting credits on sloppy operations.

# Reason why this script is relevant to your career.

# How you would talk about this script at an interview.
# "I wrote a lightweight guardrail that flags risky operational actions (like over-broad invalidations)
#  and correlates them with traffic/log surges."
